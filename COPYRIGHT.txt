ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This material is based upon work supported by the National Science
Foundation under Grant No. 0835500.

SOCIAL CONTRACT

In return for the effort so many people contribute to the OpenScholar 
project, we would appreciate it if you would give back to this collective 
effort through one of the following ways:

- If you like the OpenScholar project, please use it. Install OpenScholar 
at your University or institution, create a site and encourage others to 
do the same. Please also cite the OpenScholar project in your reports and 
publications, and spread the word at conferences, meetings and in casual 
conversation. The broader our user base becomes, the easier it is for all 
of us to improve the software to the benefit of everyone.

- If you think of a useful new feature that could improve OpenScholar, 
please suggest improvements, send us code to implement them, or sponsor 
the development of specific features with grants or gifts.

- If you find a problem, please report the issue so that we can try to 
fix it (or even better, send us a patch).

- Commercial profit-making ventures also are welcome to use OpenScholar 
software in any way consistent with our licensing requirements. In some 
cases our team may be able to provide training and technical assistance 
in support of your development efforts, when feasible and when we judge 
that such help improves the general applicability of, or promotes, the 
overall project. Support for OpenScholar via financial contributions, 
coding assistance, or temporary personnel detailed to our team, make it 
easier for us to assist your efforts.
