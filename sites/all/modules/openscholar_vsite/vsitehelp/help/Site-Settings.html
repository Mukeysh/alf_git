      <p>The <strong>Settings </strong>menu link in the Control Panel offers a variety of options for customizing your site, including changing the <strong>privacy of your posts</strong>, the display of an <strong>Admin Menu</strong>, and your <strong>Google Analytics ID</strong>.
      </p>

      <strong>Privacy</strong><p> By making your site private you can prevent anonymous viewers who don't have an OpenScholar account from seeing your content.  Additionally you can control whether your posts will be shown in other user's news feeds.
      </p><p> 
      By checking the <strong>Anonymous Contact</strong> checkbox you are allowing all site visitors to contact you via the site contact form. Leaving it unchecked
      will restrict the contact form to only registered users who are logged in.
      </p>    

      <strong>Admin Menu Bar</strong><p>By default when you're logged in and looking at your site there'll be a small button to link back to your Control Panel. Some site owners may want the full Admin Menu Bar to always appear. </p>

      <strong>Google Analytics</strong><p> Make your site work with Google Analytics, by entering your Google Analytics account ID. The analytics data is
      automatically transferred to Google Analytics for all content pages on your site.<br /> <strong>You must have Google Analytics account.</strong>
