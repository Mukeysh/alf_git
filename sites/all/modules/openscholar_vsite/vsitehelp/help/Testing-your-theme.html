      <p>To test your custom theme's CSS we have a themer kit <a href="path:themer_test_kit.zip.txt">which can be downloaded</a> (Note: remove the .txt extension and then decompress). The kit contains a dummy mini-site of files with typical markup and with links to the live base theme, as well as links to a blank css file called my-theme.css. This is where you should work. Add background images to the supplied images directory.</p>
      <p>The files may be dropped onto Firefox or another standards-compliant browser to view as you work. (Note: We've found that Dreamweaver does not accurately render the base CSS.)</p>
