<p>The Scholar Events feature comes with the ability to keep a "signup", or RSVP, list of people attending any event posted on your site. A form will be displayed below each posted event which will allow anyone to RSVP for the event. The form contains basic contact information including; name, email address, and phone. The signup list core functionality also provides you with a set of list management tools. <strong>You can access the signup list management tools by logging into your account and viewing the page for a specific event. </strong>When viewing the event page, you'll see a tab called <strong>"Signups"</strong>. Clicking on this tab will display a horizontal list of tools below. These tools are:
<br /><br />
<ul>
