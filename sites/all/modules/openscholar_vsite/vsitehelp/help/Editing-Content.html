            <p>Editing content on your site is a simple affair. You do need to be logged in to edit content but you can log in on any supported web browser on any computer anywhere. The fastest way to edit any content in your site is to go to the content in question and simply click the Edit link. This can done from within your website or from within the Control Panel.</p>
            
            <h3>Rich Text Editor</h3>
            <p>Your site comes with a rich-text editor which functions as any standard word processor might. There are options for bold, italic, lists and more. Most of these you'll recognize from word processors. These are used in the same way you'd expect. Select the text you want to change, click the button and it will be bolded, underlined,or colored for you. You'll also find a couple of website-specific options.</p>
            
            <h4>Controlling the "Teaser" Break</h4>
            <p>Many pages of content will initially show short "teasers" of each post along with a link to the full page. By default the system will try to show the first paragraph of your post as the "teaser" but you can adjust where that teaser break should go. To adjust the teaser break, move your cursor to the desired location and click the teaser break button.</p>
            
            <h4>Copying and Pasting from Other Sources</h4>
            <p>Many site owners will want to copy and paste material from other sources such as a word processor document, a PDF file, or an email. Unfortunately applications like word processors and email clients often include a lot of unwanted formatting code with each copy/paste. OpenScholar will ultimately strip away unwanted code from public view but it may appear to you in the rich text editor and may be distracting. To avoid this you can click the <strong>Paste as Plain Text button</strong> (<img class="mceItem" src="path:paste.gif" alt="" height="16" width="16" />) which will open a new popup window. By pasting into this window, all unwanted formatting code is stripped away entirely. You can then continue to format the text as you like.</p>
            
            <h4>Other Kinds of Content</h4>
            <p>There are 3 buttons that are a little more complicated. These are: Inline Image, Inline Media, and Inline Files. These controls allow you to place non-text content directly in the body of your post. Clicking any of these controls will bring up a dialog on the screen to guide you further.</p>

            <p><strong>Inline Image</strong> allows you to upload an image, download an external image or reference an existing image and include it in your post. Select a source from the available options, and choose your picture. To reference an existing image, begin typing in the filename, and we'll fetch a list of files on our server for you to choose from. Once you've chosen an image, click Insert to add it to the post.</p>

            <p><strong>Inline Media</strong> allows you to paste a link to an embeddable resource and that resource will be included in the post. For instance, if you give it a link to a Youtube video, that video will be added to your post. For a list of sites that have embeddable resources, visit <a href="http://embed.ly/providers">Embed.ly</a>. Add a URL to one of the fields, select the checkbox next to it and click Insert it to add it to the body of your post.<br>
            There is one caveat. If the owner of the video you're trying to embed has disabled embedding for that video, only a link will be embedded in your post. There is no way to embed this video in your post as anything but a link.</p>

            <p><strong>Inline Files</strong> allows you to embed a file in your post. The file will be uploaded to our server, and automatically linked to in your post, using whatever text you give it to describe it.</p>
