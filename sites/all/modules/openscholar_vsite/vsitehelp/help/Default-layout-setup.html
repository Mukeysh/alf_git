            <p>You can of course do anything you want with the CSS of your custom theme, but it's not a bad idea to know how the <strong>base theme</strong> on which you'll be essentially overriding is constructed. The <strong>base theme</strong>'s CSS is loaded before yours so many <em>default</em> <em>attributes</em> can be used if you prefer.</p>
            
            <h3>Holy Grail?</h3>
            <p>The basic default layout is based on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/holygrail/">Matthew Levine's 2006 article in A List Apart</a>. We suggest reading and familiarizing yourself with the article and logic behind it.</p>
            <p>Using our divs, this is the basic layout of all themes in OpenScholar:</p>
            <p><img src="path:holy-grail-map.png" alt="" height="495" width="630" /></p>
            
            <h3>Same for headers, with a caveat</h3>
            <p>The exact same structure and defaults are used for the header regions, however since #header-main is optional for the site owner there's additional default CSS declarations allowing for only left and right header areas.</p><table id="attachments" class="sticky-enabled">
