            <p>Managing your content is primarily done in the Control Panel by clicking on the Content menu button. You can select multiple posts at a time and choose between a variety of options, such as <strong>publishing</strong> or <strong>unpublishing </strong>(i.e. making content visible to the public),&nbsp;<strong>bulk deletions</strong>, <strong>adding</strong> or <strong>removing from your front page</strong>, etc.</p>
            
            <h3>"Sticky" Posts</h3>
            <p>Posts marked "Sticky" stick to the top of any list in which they appear. Normally posts are displayed in the order of their publication but there maybe times when you want to feature particular posts.</p>
