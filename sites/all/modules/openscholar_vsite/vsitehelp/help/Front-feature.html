            <p>The Front feature allows you to customize the content on your front page. You can customize your front page by navigating to the <strong>Features</strong> section of the control panel and selecting the corresponding "customize" link. 
</p>

<p>
<h2> Choosing your front page content</h2>
You can select from the following ways to determine the content for your site's front page:

<p> <strong>Posts from specific feature(s)</strong> - This option will display all content from a specific feature on your front page.  After selecting this option, you will see a checkbox appear for each feature that you have installed on your site. For example, if you selected the publications checkbox, your front page will contain a list of your publication posts. </p>

<p><strong>One of your posts</strong> - This option will designate one of your posts to be displayed as your front page content.
If you select this option, you'll see a text field appear below. Begin typing the title of the post and the field will try to auto-populate the title. Note: that when you select an existing title, you'll see a small notation added to the end,  such as <strong> [nid:19] </strong>. This notation is used by the web site when processing your front page settings,<strong> so  you should not remove this notation. </strong></p>

<p>You can also click on the <strong>"+Add new" </strong>link to create a new post as your front page content.</p>

<p><strong>Hand-pick content as you go </strong> - By selecting this option, you will have a ability to hand select individual posts of any type to appear on your front page. To do this, go to any post and click on the <strong>"Admin Options"</strong> button just below the post. Next, a list of choices will appear. Select "Featured Post" to set this post as your front page content. </p>
 
  </p>
  <p>
  <h2>Widgets</h2>
  The Front feature comes with two default widgets:  <strong>Announcements</strong> and <strong>Upcoming events</strong>. By default these widgets will appear in the right sidebar. The Front feature settings provide text fields for renaming these widgets.</p>
