                <p>Blogs today have become a mainstay of discussion in the internet. The word "blog" is derived from the term "web log" and is fashioned after a journaling style of writing. Blogging has evolved into more that just personal thoughts.&nbsp; Academic blog entries could be focused on technical observations specific to a field of discipline or study, or a series of opinion-oriented blurbs about current events. Web users will typically "follow" a blog that they are interested in which means that they will frequently check, or be notified, when new blog entries are posted.</p> 
                <p>The blog feature adds a blog section to your site as well as blogging tools for you.</p> 
                <p><strong>Creating Blog Entries</strong></p> 
                <p>To add a blog from your site, browse to your site and click the "Blog" link in your primary menu. Next click on the link that says "+ Add Blog entry" and begin writing your blog.</p>
                <p>When writing your blog, keep in mind that you can also attach files to you blog entries. For example, if you were writing some blog commentary on an article that is not published on the web, but you have the PDF file of the article, then you can attach the PDF file to the blog post. You have the ability to create "Tags" or categories for every blog entry. You can also use existing tags that you had created previously for other content.&nbsp; Visitors can also find specific blog entries by browsing the categories that you have selected for it.</p>

                <p><strong>Public versus Private Blog</strong></p>
                <p>You may want your blog to be viewable only by a specific or trusted audience.
