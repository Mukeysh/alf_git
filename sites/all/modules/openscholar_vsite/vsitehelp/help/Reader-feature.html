<p><h3>What is Feed?</h3></p>
<p>A feed is a web technology that pulls in rapidly or frequently updating information from a web source. The information is often displayed as dynamically changing list. A common type of content used in web feeds are news headlines. New headlines are constantly being created, so this content really lends itself to being displayed as a feed.</p>
<p>The great thing about a feed is that once you set it up, the information will automatically update as it changes. Having feeds on your site is a way to make your site lively and dynamic.</p>
<p><h3>How I find feeds for my site?</h3></p>
<p>The Feeds feature will process feeds from external web sources. Many web sites will offer feeds for their content, such as latest news.&nbsp; You should browse the web sites that have interest and relevance to your web site and look for the orange feed icon. It may say "RSS" feed, which is a type of feed format.</p>
