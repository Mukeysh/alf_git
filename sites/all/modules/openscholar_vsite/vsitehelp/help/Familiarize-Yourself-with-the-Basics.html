            <p>Once logged in you'll be sent to your site. Take a moment to become familiar with some basic elements of your web site.</p>
            
            <h2>General Layout</h2>
            <p>By default the site is laid out in a manner similar to many web sites. There is a header area where you'll find the photo you uploaded; your name and professional title, address, and, by default, the Harvard shield. By default there are three menu options in the primary menu: <strong>Bio/CV</strong>, <strong>Classes</strong>, and <strong>Publications</strong>. As no content has yet been added you'll otherwise see an essentially blank site.</p>
	    <h2>Useful Links</h2>

            <h4>Quick access to common settings</h4>
	    <p>
	      <img class="mceItem" src="path:Quick_Access.png" alt="" height="292" width="725" />
	    </P>

            <h4>Add New</h4> 
            <p><img class="mceItem" src="path:Add_New.png" alt="" height="19" width="76" /> Click on the <strong>"Add New"</strong> to add new content to the site for enabled features like Class, Event, Gallery, Publication ect..
	      You'll want to look for <strong>"Add New"</strong> green links with a plus sign through out your site. These links will be visible on pages wherever you can add new material. They are context-specific so if you're on the <strong>Bio</strong> page an<strong> "Add New Bio and CV"</strong> link appears. If on your <strong>Publications</strong> page, an <strong>"Add New Publication"</strong> link appear.
	    </p>
            <h4>Configuration Gear</h4>
	    <p><img class="mceItem" src="path:gear.png" alt="" height="22" width="22" /> Use the gear to configure your Site Title and Front Layout. 

            <p>Click on <strong>Bio/CV</strong> and you'll be presented with another blank page, this time with two additional tabs: <strong>Biography</strong>, and <strong>Curriculum Vitae</strong>. You'll also see a new link <strong>"Add your Bio"</strong>, distinguished as a red link with a plus sign.</p>
