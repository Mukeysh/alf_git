            <p>The Profiles feature allows you to create, categorize, and publish, profiles of people who are contributors to your project. Enabling this feature will create a section of your site called "People". To add a profile, browse to the "People" section of your site and click on the <strong> + Add Person</strong> button.                 
</p>
             <p>The Profiles feature also comes with a widget called "Categories" which will display an organized list of people by the category that you provided when saving the profile. Please note that the "Categories" widget will only appear if you have created a category when saving the profile. Categories can be added or changed at any time by editing the profile.        
              </p>
              
                         <p>  The Profile feature settings allow you to customized the names of the primary menu link "People" and the name of the widget "Categories". To access any feature's settings, go to the control panel and select "Features" and click on the feature's corresponding "customize" link.
