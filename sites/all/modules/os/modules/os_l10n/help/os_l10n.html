<h1>Translation</h1>
<p>
Drupal localization modules allow site users to translate site content on the fly.  
These translations are published back to Drupal so other sites can make use of them.  
Each Drupal installation can be configured to periodically check for new translation
updates.
</p>

<p>
OpenScholar includes several modules for facilitating the translation process.
</p>

<h1>For Site Administrators</h1>
<p>
To enable localization on your OpenScholar installation, follow these steps:
	<ol>
	  <li>Enable Localization Client (l10n_client), Localization Update (l10n_update), 
	  and OpenScholar Translation (os_l10n) modules.</li>
	  <li>Give your users permissions to translate.  You may wish to create a translator
	   role to assign to users.
	    <ul>
	      <li><b>use on-page translation</b> This permission will let users translate 
	        text on your site.</li>
	    </ul>
	  <li>Enable additional languages.  English is fully translated already.  In order to
	    access the translation GUI, your site needs to use a langauge that isn't fully
        translated.  You can change the site's default language as well, or instruct
        your users to change their account settings.   OpenScholar Translation provides settings
        that enable users to specify their own languages.  Languages can be added in the
        admin/settings/language section of your installation.
      </li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h1>For Translators</h1>
<p>
  The first step to translate OpenScholar is viewing OpenScholar in a non-English language.
  If that's already the case, please skip ahead.  If not, you'll have to open your account
  settings (DOMAIN.COM/user and then click edit).  Scroll down to the langauge settings 
  section and choose a language that isn't English.  If that doesn't change your view of
  OpenScholar or if the language you wish to translate isn't listed, you'll have to contact
  your site's administrator.
</p>
<p>
  At the bottom of each page you should be able to see the translate bar.  If you cannot, 
  your site/account has not been configured properly for translation.  Send your site admin
  an email requesting translating permission.

</p>

<p>
  To begin translating, click on the translate bar.  This will open up a pane at the 
  bottom of your screen.  On the left of that pane is a list of bits of text that appear
  on this page.  Text with a green background has already been translated into your
  language.  Everything else is still waiting to be translated.
</p>

<p>
  Click on a piece of text from the left hand column.  The original text will be displayed
  in the center of the screen.  On the right, you'll be able to provide a translation.
  Enter your translation and then click the save button.
