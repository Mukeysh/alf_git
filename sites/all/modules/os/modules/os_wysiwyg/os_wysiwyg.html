<p>The <strong>WYSIWYG</strong> (<b>W</b>hat <b>Y</b>ou <b>S</b>ee <b>I</b>s <b>W</b>hat 
<b>Y</b>ou <b>G</b>et) editor allows you to preview changes 
you make to a post as you make them. It comes with several controls to make creating
and editing new posts easier. Most of these you'll recognize from word processors, 
such as bold, underline, font color, etc. These are used in the same way you'd expect.
Select the text you want to change, click the button and it will be bolded, underlined,
or colored for you.</p>

<p>There are 3 buttons that are a little more complicated. These are: Inline Image, 
Inline Media, and Inline Files. These controls allow you to place non-text content
directly in the body of your post. Clicking any of these controls will bring up 
a dialog on the screen to guide you further.</p>

<p><strong>Inline Image</strong> allows you to upload an image, download an external
image or reference an existing image and include it in your post. Select a source 
from the available options, and choose your picture. To reference an existing image, begin
typing in the filename, and we'll fetch a list of files on our server for you to choose from.
Once you've chosen an image, click Insert to add it to the post.</p>

<p><strong>Inline Media</strong> allows you to paste a link to an embeddable resource 
and that resource will be included in the post. For instance, if you give it a link
to a Youtube video, that video will be added to your post. For a list of sites that 
have embeddable resources, visit <a href="http://embed.ly/providers">Embed.ly</a>. 
Add a URL to one of the fields, select the checkbox next to it and click Insert it to 
add it to the body of your post.</p>

<p><strong>Inline Files</strong> allows you to embed a file in your post. The file will 
be uploaded to our server, and automatically linked to in your post, using whatever text 
you give it to describe it.</p>
