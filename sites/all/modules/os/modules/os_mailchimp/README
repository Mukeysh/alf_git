This module allows drupal users to sign up for MailChimp mailing lists.  It does this in two ways.  

The first is a user hook that automatically signs up new users to the site.  The location and API
key for the mailing list are available in your sites admin page.  You will need to enter an API
key before you can choose a list.  Ignoring these fields will prevent these automatic signups from
happening.

The second is a box that this module provides.  It lets users sign up via a form.  A default box is 
provided.  This box uses the same API key/mailing list that was set in the admin page.  Additional 
boxes can be created to use different keys and lists.  API keys can be set per space, to prevent you
from having to keep re-entering the same key.
