<p>The Publications features offers a number of methods for grouping your Publications together. This widget 
allows you to pick one of these groupings and drop into a side bar.</p>
<p>The Year category will put all your publications from a certain year together. The Type category will put
publications from the same medium together, such as Book, Journal Article or Magazine Article. The Co-Author 
category will group your publications by the people you've worked with.</p>
<p>The Display Number of Items checkbox will put a number next to the Category that displays the number of 
Publications in that grouping.</p>

<p>Example Output:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Books (3)</li>
  <li>Journal Articles (5)</li>
  <li>Magazine Articles (2)</li>
