Form Columns UI provides an interface for arranging forms into columns. 

Begin by entering a form_id or path into the main form. This will add your form
to formcolumn's database and allow you to position its forms with a drag and drop interface. 

Form Columns UI allows site builders to export their form column configuration via Features.
